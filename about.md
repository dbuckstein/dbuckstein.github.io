## Bio

![Portrait](/assets/img/dbuckstein-photo.png){: style="float:left; padding:10px" width="300px"}

A graduate of UOIT in Ontario, Canada, Dan holds a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, majoring in Game Development & Entrepreneurship.  He has a keen interest various areas of mathematics, including calculus and linear algebra, both of which carry over to computer animation and graphics.  Dan also practices low-level programming and building clean, modular code and frameworks.  This has been demonstrated in a long-standing passion for creating high- and low-level graphics and animation tools in both industry and academic contexts.  His programming and development interests include game engines, tool design, virtual reality and augmented reality.  Dan's passion for programming intertwines with his passion for teaching and he is always looking for innovative ways to deliver course content.


## Interests & Experience Highlights

* **Graphics programming**
	* Significant experience creating proprietary modern renderers and effects, most commonly with OpenGL and GLSL, all completely from scratch using C and sometimes C++.  Currently learning Vulkan (finally) and writing a new renderer in C.
	* Mindful of platform-specific APIs, such as Metal for Apple products and Direct3D for Microsoft products; the main goal is to have my renderers be as programmer-friendly and as cross-platform as possible.
* **Animation programming**
	* Deeply passionate about character animation algorithms, from temporal to spatial and everything in between.
	* Proud to have created my own IK solvers from scratch... still much to learn.
* **3D mathematics**
	* Significant experience creating 3D math libraries, including vectors, matrices and quaternions.
	* Math is not scary, it just takes practice!  I love finding ways to explain the wonders of 3D math to those new to it!
* **General programming**
	* Always pushing the need for robust tools and clear UI to meet the needs of designers and artists.
	* Curious about assembly and low-level programming.
	* Modern C and C++?  There's nothing I can't learn when I just RTFM.

	
## Specialty Courses

* **Introduction to Modern Graphics Programming**
	* Practitioner of a unique "shaders-first" approach: Instead of having students dive head-first into raw OpenGL, it is important to have them work backwards from what they see on the screen... which is also more fun!
* **Intermediate Graphics & Animation Programming**
	* Now with the necessary experience with vertex and fragment shaders, students explore the fundamentals of managing and extending a proprietary OpenGL renderer.  We explore topics such as post-processing, tessellation and interpolation, forward kinematics... and more!
* **Advanced Animation Programming**
	* This course takes a deeper dive into real-time character control.  We experience keyframe control techniques, animation blending and layers, inverse kinematics and modern issues and technological advances in animation.
* **Game Physics**
	* Students learn the fundamentals of motion, from integration to collision detection and response.  We begin in 2D, then introduce the intermediate 3D concepts such as inertia tensors, quaternions and physically-based animation.
* **Others**
	* Networking for Online Games
	* Advanced Real-Time Rendering
	* Game Studio Capstone
