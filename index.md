# Greetings

Welcome to the shiny new portfolio website of ***Daniel S. Buckstein***, game programmer and lifelong learner.  I enjoy many types of math-intensive programming, including graphics programming, and shaders, animation and physics programming, tools programming, from low-level to high-level engineering, from back-end to front-end interfaces, from older to more modern languages, etc.  My only regret at this very moment is that web programming is not among the things I was ever deeply passionate about.  Therefore, dear reader, please forgive me for this plain old website, powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), and evidently void of the hassle of style, so that I may focus on producing and publishing only the finest portfolio materials for your reading and viewing pleasure.  Then again, this _is_ an open-source repository, so feel free to beautify as you see fit... please just don't break the build!
