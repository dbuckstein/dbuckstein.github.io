# Welcome

I am trying my hand at creating a basic blog site with Jekyll, to be hosted with GitHub Pages.  For all intents and purposes, this simple setup is perfect for both development on my local environment, and displaying on the web.  Check this out:

On the left is how it looks like online (the real thing) and on the right is how it looks to me locally.  As you can see, I'm not picky.  I see some code and some math, so I can test and rest assured that it'll likely be fine when published.

If that wasn't enough, this Jekyll serve thing just auto-updates it whenever I save!  Why didn't I do this earlier, it's fantastic!

Check back for newer and cooler posts soon.
